React JS useParams Hook helps to access the parameters of the current route to manage the dynamic routes in the URL. 
;The react-router-dom package has useParams hooks that let you access and use the parameters of the current route as required.

Prerequisites:
NPM & Node.js
React JS

Approach:
Define the dynamic routes for the specific components in which we want to access parameters.
Using the useParams hook access the URL and hence the params from the URL.
Use the Params inside the component and display it on the UI.

Like in below route we'll get id from URL with help of useParams() hook.

<Route path="/page/:id">

</Route>
