what we're doing here is in index.js we've created routes and <App/> is included inside route and
outlet in App.js is choosing one of the children according to path of children in Home screen component as soon as page loaded
we have sent get request to API for all products showing then on screen and we have make images and name of 
product as clickable and as sson as we are clicking on image or name of product that are bringing us to a 
perticular kind of url which contains is init.

Which pattern is matching with url of productscreen present in route of index.js second child.
Now in productscreen we are getting id of product from url and sending get request to backend for that perticular 
product details and we're showing everything related to that product on screen.
