this is how aliasing works inside an object:

supppose this is an object

const user = {
  id: 1,
  name: 'Alice',
  age: 30
};

now we're destructering it and aliasing like below:

const { name: userName, age: userAge } = user;

console.log(userName); // Output: Alice
console.log(userAge); // Output: 30

In this example:

name is aliased to userName.
age is aliased to userAge.

//this is how aliasing works inside an object.
